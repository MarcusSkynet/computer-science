    "# Linked List and Doubly Linked List Implementation\n",

    "## Introduction to Nodes and Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nodes\n",
    "A **node** is a fundamental part of a linked list. It contains two main components:\n",
    "1. **Value/Data**: This is the data stored in the node.\n",
    "2. **Next Reference**: A pointer or reference to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a singly linked list, each node only points to the next node, while in a doubly linked list, each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked Lists\n",
    "A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element is a separate object called a node, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. This makes insertion and deletion operations more efficient compared to arrays, especially when dealing with dynamic data where the number of elements changes frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of linked lists:\n",
    "1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to `None`, indicating the end of the list.\n",
    "2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.\n",
    "3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node's next reference points back to the head of the list, forming a loop.\n"
